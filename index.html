<h1>My First Webpage</h1>
<p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including reading books and going shopping. At least once a day, I spend my free time reading a book. I enjoy reading books because they teach me new things. I usually read historical fiction, but I'm not a fan of fantasy. My other interest is shopping, which I enjoy doing a lot.
I go shopping with my family on weekends because I enjoy shopping with them. When I'm styling my family, I can consume media from the outside world while feeling at ease.</p>
